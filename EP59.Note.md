# Item 8

<code/item8.py> demonstrates nested list comprehension for 2-D matrix operations.

# Item 11

- The `zip` built-in function is a lazy generator that produces tuples.
- `itertools.zip_longest`

# Item 18 Reduce Visual Noise with Variable Positional Arguments

The `*` have two different meanings in two different contexts:
1. When calling a function, `*` can be used to unpack a sequence or 
   a generator to provide the positional arguments for a function.
   ```Python
   def foo(a, b, c):
       print(a, b, c)

   x = [1, 2, 3]
   foo(*x)  # 1 2 3
   ```   
2. Functions can accept a variable positional arguments by using
   `*args` in the `def` statement. And `args` is a tuple in the function
   body.

Two issues:
1. The variable arguments are always turned into a tuple before they are
   passed to the function (`args` is a tuple inside the function.) If the
   caller of the function uses the `*` operator on a generator, it will be
   iterated until it's exhausted, which could consume a lot of memory.
2. If we try to add new positional arguments existing callers need 
   migration. We should use keyword-only arguments when we want to extend 
   functions that accept `*args`.


# Item 19 Provide Optional Behavior with Keyword Arguments

- All positional arguments to Python functions can also be passed by keyword.
- The keyword arguments can be passed in any order as long as all of the 
  required positional arguments are specified.
- You can mix and match keyword and positional arguments but
  - Positional arguments must be specified before keyword arguments.
  - Each argument can only be specified once.

Benefits:
1. clearer code readability
2. default values
3. a powerful way to extend a function's parameters while remaining 
   backwards compatible with existing callers.
