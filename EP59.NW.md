# Preface

- The Python programming language has unique strengths and charms that can 
  be hard to **grasp**.
- These standard packages are so closely **intertwined** with idiomatic 
  Python that they may as well be part of the language specification.
- It's useful to view some of the examples in this book as whole programs 
  without **interleaved prose**.

# Acknowledgments

- Without all of your help, this book would have been **inscrutable**.
- I appreciate your **tutelage** and leadership.
- Nine years ago he **cut his teeth** using Python to manage Google's 
  enormous fleet of servers.

# Pythonic Thinking

- The Pythonic style isn't **regimented** or enforced by the compiler. 

# Item 4

- Python's **pithy** syntax makes it easy to write single-line expressions 
  that implement a lot of logic.

# Item 18

- If you try to add a positional argument in the front of the argument list, 
  existing callers will **subtly** break if they aren't updated.

# Item 19

- For example, say you want to compute the rate of fluid flowing into a 
  **vat**.
- If the vat is also on a **scale**, then you could use the difference 
  between two weight measurements at two different times to determine the 
  flow rate.
